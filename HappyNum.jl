once we get our output from the function, this while loop checks whether the returned sum is equal to 1 or 4 or not. Once it has done that the sum is 
returned back to the function and the while loop is run once again and this goes on untill we get 1 as the sum and if it gets stuck in the loop then 
we say it's not a happy number.
